How it works:

   1. Students fill their preferences and lock their choices before the deadline.
   2. The Allocator then runs the algorithm for each round allocating the student to the respective colleges. (Multiple round allocation is implemented).
   3. It takes care of various factors like gender and category in determining the matching.
   4. Final list of the students with the colleges is made ready.
